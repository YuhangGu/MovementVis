cf. city flows is an installation that combines multiple visualizations of bike-sharing journeys in three cities. It applies established mapping and visualization techniques within a highly aestheticized framework in order to animate visitors to engage with urban mobility.

cf. city flows has three viewing modes, all visualizing trips of rented bikes, but focusing on different levels of spatial and temporal granularity of cycling mobility:


The `citywide view` aggregates all trajectories of bike-sharing trips for a given day and animates the trails for trips at a given time.


In the `station view` only the bike trips to and from a selected station are shown, allowing the distinction between incoming and outgoing.


A `small-multiple view` visualizes spatio-temporal patterns for three selected stations each in an exploded view that separates incoming from outgoing and morning from afternoon/evening trips.

The interaction with the visualization is provided via a tablet embedded in a plinth at about one meter distance to the display wall. A dashboard on the tablet shows further details about the bike-sharing systems such as the total number of stations, bikes, and trips as well as morning and evening trips per city. The temporal fluctuation of trips over the day is displayed as a horizon chart.
